# Guide to Analyzing Research Papers with an LLM Assistant

Here are 10 questions to help systematically understand a research paper, arranged to progressively build understanding from basic context to deeper analysis:

1. "What is the main research question or problem that this paper aims to address? Please explain it in simple terms."

2. "What field or discipline does this research belong to, and who are the target readers?"

3. "Can you summarize the paper's key methodology - how did the researchers approach solving their research question?"

4. "What are the 2-3 most important findings or conclusions from this research?"

5. "What previous work or theories did the authors build upon? How does this paper connect to existing research?"

6. "What specific experiments or studies were conducted? Please break down the key steps."

7. "What evidence do the authors present to support their conclusions? How strong is this evidence?"

8. "What are the practical implications or real-world applications of these findings?"

9. "What limitations or potential weaknesses did the authors acknowledge in their research?"

10. "What future research directions do the authors suggest, and what questions remain unanswered?"

## Best Practices
1. Break down complex sections into smaller, manageable chunks
2. Ask for examples or analogies when concepts are unclear
3. Rephrase explanations in your own words to confirm understanding
4. Request simpler explanations if responses are too technical
5. Save detailed questions about specific sections for later phases
6. Take notes and build up your understanding incrementally

## Tips for Effective Interaction
1. Quote specific sections when asking for clarification
2. Ask one question at a time to maintain focus
3. Confirm your understanding before moving to more complex topics
4. Request concrete examples for abstract concepts
5. Ask for alternative explanations if the first one isn't clear
